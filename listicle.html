			When's the last time you've had an Italian soda? It had been a while for me, but I wanted to join my friend<br>
			for a non-caffeinated beverage at Bytes and I became reaquainted with the combination of fizzy water and<br>
			artificial fruit syrup. Italian sodas are not so sweet as a normal soda and not so boring as a flavored<br> 
			carbonated water. The Italian sodas at Bytes also have no cream in them (or maybe they do if you ask;I<br> haven't tried), which makes it a nice coffee shop alternative for the times when you're<br>
			feeling a refreshing drink that doesn't have caffeine or milk.

			<span style="font-weight:bold">Recommendation</span>: Raspberry Italian soda

			When your boba craving strikes, head over to Pop Tea Bar, a cute little bubble tea shop on Cambridge<br>
			Avenue. The menu is your standard bubble tea fare with nothing too adventurous on the menu -- no<br>
			bubble tea floats, for example -- but the tapioca is fresh, the service is fast, and the tea is smooth and<br>
			delicious! They have little bites to eat too, like popcorn chicken and eggrolls, in perfect snack-size portions.<br>
			There's not too much seating, but there's a cute outdoor area in the back for warmer days.
			<div class="space"></div>
			Pop Tea Bar isn't exactly on campus, but the Marguerite has got you covered. Ride the 1050A to California<br>
			and El Camino and it's a short walk from there. (11 minutes total from the Gates Computer Science<br>
			Building!)
			<div class="space"></div>
			<span style="font-weight:bold">Recommendation</span>: Classic Milk Tea with tapioca + an order of popcorn chicken.

			I can't tell you whether CoHo has a particularly amazing Vanilla Bean Latte, only because CoHo is the only<br>
			place I've ever ordered a Vanilla Bean Latte from. I'm not even totally sure I know what a Vanilla Bean Latte<br>
			is supposed to taste like. What I do know is the Vanilla Bean Latte I ordered on a whim from CoHo was<br>
			delicious.

			Nexus Cafe has a lot of tasty things packed into its cafeteria space, including agua fresca! Grab a cup of this<br>
			fresh and fruity beverage before you head to the check out line. Nexus Cafe has plenty of indoor and<br>
			outdoor seating, too, so on the next sunny day, take a break on the patio with a cup of agua fresca, and<br>
			maybe a burrito.
